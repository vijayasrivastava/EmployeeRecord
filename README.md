# EmployeeRecord
A menu driven program that allows us to perform CRUD operations on Employee Records namely Insert, Display, Search, Delete and Update.

It starts by giving the user five options:
#1: INSERT
#2: DISPLAY
#3: SEARCH
#4: DELETE
#5: UPDATE

The Employee records are stored temporarily in an Array List and can be optimized by linking it to a MySQL server.
This code aims to understand CRUD operations by creating a list of the data type employee and performing various operations on it.
