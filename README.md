# EmployeeRecord
A menu driven program that allows us to perform CRUD operations on Employee Records namely Insert, Display, Search, Delete and Update on a Employee database using MySQL in JDBC.

It starts by giving the user five options:
#1: INSERT
#2: DISPLAY
#3: SEARCH
#4: DELETE
#5: UPDATE

The Employee records are stored in a MySQL server and are edited using the JAVA file implementing JDBC concepts in MySQL.
